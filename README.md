FilmQuest is a dynamic web application that provides users with comprehensive movie information and discovery tools. Built with React and Node.js, it leverages movie database APIs to deliver up-to-date information about films, including top-rated movies, new releases, and detailed search capabilities.

## Features

- Browse curated movie lists
- Search movies by title, year, genre, and film type
- Advanced filtering options
- Responsive design for all devices

- Image validation to ensure high-quality movie posters

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React 18.3.1
- React Bootstrap
- CSS3
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- Axios for API requests
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (Comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

3. Install backend dependencies:

## Configuration

The backend requires API keys to access movie data. Create your own API keys from the MovieDatabase API service:

1. Sign up at RapidAPI
2. Subscribe to the MovieDatabase API
3. Copy your API key
4. Update the API keys in `server.js`

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The server will start on port 4000.

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
The application will open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

- Use the navigation bar to browse different movie categories
- Apply filters using the dropdown menus to refine your search
